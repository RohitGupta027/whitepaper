## How to Build

### Install Docker

Docker can be installed running the following:

* For [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/), you can run
  `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh` on your command line and
  everything is done automatically (if you have curl installed, which
  is normally the case),
* For [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/)
* For [Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/)

### Build

After installing docker run the build shell script from a unix like command line:

```
./build.sh
```
